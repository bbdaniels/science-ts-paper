The Minister also outlined that while changes would not go through in December  –  as was recently feared  –  the new proposed tariffs would apply to all new solar PV installations with an eligibility date on or after 12 December 2011. These installations would receive the current tariff rates before moving to the lower tariffs on 1 April 2012.
